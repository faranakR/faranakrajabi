## Hi, I'm Faranak 👋

I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering with a concurrent Master's in Computer Science at the **[Computational Applied Science Laboratory (CASL)](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~fgibou/)** at **[UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/)**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **computational physics**, **high-performance computing**, and **multiscale modeling**, with applications to complex biological systems.

Currently, I'm developing a multiscale continuum framework for protein aggregation in high-concentration biotherapeutic formulations. This work bridges molecular-scale protein dynamics with continuum PDEs to predict long-term stability of therapeutic proteins using level-set methods, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel computing. I also work on stochastic optimal control of neural oscillators with applications to Parkinson's disease.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BS in Aerospace Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran. I'm also passionate about teaching scientific computing, having instructed 1000+ students, and offer consulting in computational methods and programming.

Please feel free to reach out if our work or interests align! **[Schedule a meeting](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ3_BzygdfmAjpLYVsIno5k5evzktA6aiSIdjgs=)** or **[email me](mailto:faranakrajabi@ucsb.edu)**.

## For Iran 🖤

These days, my heart is with my honorable compatriots, the mourning families of nearly 20,000 lives lost in the recent protests. Every single family is grieving for their loved ones.

The Supreme Leader rules over an ocean of blood. This is the largest massacre in modern Iranian history, and one of the deadliest crackdowns against a people fighting for freedom in the 21st century.

An end to the Islamic Republic. A free, secular, democratic Iran. Freedom after 45 years of oppression.
