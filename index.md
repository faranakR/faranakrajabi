## Hi, I'm Faranak 👋

I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering with a concurrent Master's in Computer Science at the **[Computational Applied Science Laboratory (CASL)](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~fgibou/)** at **[UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/)**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **computational physics**, **high-performance computing**, and **multiscale modeling**, with applications to complex biological systems.

Currently, I'm developing a multiscale continuum framework for protein aggregation in high-concentration biotherapeutic formulations. This work bridges molecular-scale protein dynamics with continuum PDEs to predict long-term stability of therapeutic proteins using level-set methods, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel computing. I also work on stochastic optimal control of neural oscillators with applications to Parkinson's disease.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BS in Aerospace Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran. I'm also passionate about teaching scientific computing, having instructed 1000+ students, and offer consulting in computational methods and programming.

Please feel free to reach out if our work or interests align! **[Schedule a meeting](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments)** or **[email me](mailto:faranakrajabi@ucsb.edu)**.

### On the Job Market 🎯

I'm actively seeking positions in computational science, scientific software development, and applied mathematics. If my profile aligns with opportunities at your organization, I'd love to connect!
