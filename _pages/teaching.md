> *"When you teach any branch of physics you must motivate the formalism — it isn't any good just to present the formalism and say that it agrees with experiment — you have to explain to the students why this [is] the way the world is. After all, this is our aim in physics, not just to describe nature, but to explain nature."*  
> — Steven Weinberg, 1997

I'm passionate about teaching scientific computing and coding! I have instructed **1000+ students** across multiple engineering courses at UC Santa Barbara, focusing on making computational methods accessible through hands-on exercises and real-world applications.

## Student Testimonials 

> *"Faranak was an absolutely phenomenal TA for this class: She did not stop talking, and everything she said was useful. She provided good explanations of student questions and what was on the homework, and for the two times I needed her to look at my code, she thoroughly dug through my code and was able to explain multiple fixes which improved my code and made it function properly; and with the notes she gave me, I learned quite a bit about how to use Matlab in the process. I seriously appreciate her ability to teach."*  
> — Student, Introduction to Programming (Summer 2025)

> *"I just wanted to thank you for your help throughout this quarter. You provided very detailed lectures in the hopes of helping us complete our homework and stayed during office hours many hours past when you needed to. I hope your doctorate goes well and you enjoy the rest of your time at UCSB."*  
> — Alec Perkins, Student (December 2023)

> *"There is nothing I can think of that Faranak needs to improve on. She would always respond quickly to homework concerns I had and provide as much help as I needed. Thank you!!"*  
> — Student, Spring 2023

> *"Openness to students' questions. The lectures were very clear and I felt like I really could understand what you were lecturing about."*  
> — Student, Spring 2022

> *"The quick walkthroughs before the lab helped a lot with understanding the concepts as well as the procedure."*  
> — Student, Electronics and Circuits (Spring 2023)

> *"I like how well-prepared the pre-lab presentations/explanations were. Also, I know everybody asks for help during the lab so I appreciate you getting to everybody as much as possible."*  
> — Student, Electronics and Circuits (Spring 2023)

> *"The TA was available to answer any questions that were presented and did so in a clear manner, making it very useful."*  
> — Student, Electronics and Circuits (Spring 2023)

> *"The rederivation of certain concepts useful in labs."*  
> — Student, Electronics and Circuits (Spring 2023)

> *"Their willingness to go over specific issues both in lab and on homework made it very easy to see the small details and mistakes in work."*  
> — Student, Electronics and Circuits (Spring 2023)
