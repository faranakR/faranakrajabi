title: "About Me"
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, working in the Computational Applied Science Laboratory (CASL) under Prof. Frédéric Gibou and Prof. Jeff Moehlis.

My research develops high-performance computational frameworks for solving complex partial differential equations with applications in optimal control, stochastic dynamics, and biophysical modeling. I specialize in C++/PETSc development, adaptive mesh refinement, and GPU-accelerated numerical methods.

Currently, I'm focused on building **CASL-HJX**, a comprehensive computational platform for deterministic and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and applying these methods to control problems in neuroscience and biotherapeutics.

Beyond research, I'm passionate about teaching (1000+ students instructed), mentoring undergraduates in computational science, and making advanced numerical methods accessible through open-source software.
